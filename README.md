# 1. Overall Project Objectives
The problem this project aims to solve is predicting student dropout rates based on their social backgrounds and behavioral patterns. The goal of this project is to create models that can predict students who are inclined to dropuout with a focus on improving the true positive rate. True positive rate is the evaluating metric of maximizing interest because it correctly identifies as many actual at-risk students as possible. This focus is important because it allows organizaitons in educational sectors to take early action to assist the students who need it most.

# 2. Description of Data
The Dropout dataset is downloaded from Kaggle website. In total, there are 650 student records and 34 features.
